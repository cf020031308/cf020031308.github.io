# Lynx User Defaults File
# 
# This file contains options saved from the Lynx Options Screen (normally
# with the 'o' key).  To save options with that screen, you must select the
# checkbox:
#	Save options to disk
#
# You must then save the settings using the link on the line above the
# checkbox:
#	Accept Changes
#
# You may also use the command-line option "-forms_options", which displays
# the simpler Options Menu instead.  Save options with that using the '>' key.
# 
# There is normally no need to edit this file manually, since the defaults
# here can be controlled from the Options Screen, and the next time options
# are saved from the Options Screen this file will be completely rewritten.
# You have been warned...
# 
# If you are looking for the general configuration file - it is normally
# called "lynx.cfg".  It has different content and a different format.
# It is not this file.

# accept_all_cookies allows the user to tell Lynx to automatically
# accept all cookies if desired.  The default is "FALSE" which will
# prompt for each cookie.  Set accept_all_cookies to "TRUE" to accept
# all cookies.

# anonftp_password allows the user to tell Lynx to use the personal
# email address as the password for anonymous ftp.  If no value is given,
# Lynx will use the personal email address.  Set anonftp_password
# to a different value if you choose.

# and the corresponding keyboard numbers will act as arrow keys,

# appear next to each link and numbers are used to select links.
# If keypad_mode is set to "LINKS_AND_FORM_FIELDS_ARE_NUMBERED", then
# numbers will appear next to each link and visible form input field.
# Numbers are used to select links, or to move the "current link" to a
# form input field or button.  In addition, options in popup menus are
# indexed so that the user may type an option number to select an option in
# a popup menu, even if the option isn't visible on the screen.  Reference
# lists and output from the list command also enumerate form inputs.
# NOTE: Some fixed format documents may look disfigured when

# lineedit_mode specifies the key binding used for inputting strings in

# personal_mail_address specifies your personal mail address.  The
# address will be sent during HTTP file transfers for authorization and
# logging purposes, and for mailed comments.
# If you do not want this information given out, set the NO_FROM_HEADER
# to TRUE in lynx.cfg, or use the -nofrom command line switch.  You also
# could leave this field blank, but then you won't have it included in
# your mailed comments.
personal_mail_address=

# personal_mail_name specifies your personal name, for mail.  The
# name is sent for mailed comments.  Lynx will prompt for this,
# showing the configured value as a default when sending mail.
# This is not necessarily the same as a name provided as part of the
# personal_mail_address.
# Lynx does not save your changes to that default value as a side-effect
# of sending email.  To update the default value, you must use the options
# menu, or modify this file directly.
personal_mail_name=

# preferred_charset specifies the character set in MIME notation (e.g.,
# ISO-8859-2, ISO-8859-5) which Lynx will indicate you prefer in requests
# to http servers using an Accept-Charset header.  The value should NOT
# include ISO-8859-1 or US-ASCII, since those values are always assumed
# by default.  May be a comma-separated list.
# If a file in that character set is available, the server will send it.
# If no Accept-Charset header is present, the default is that any
# character set is acceptable.  If an Accept-Charset header is present,
# and if the server cannot send a response which is acceptable
# according to the Accept-Charset header, then the server SHOULD send
# an error response, though the sending of an unacceptable response
# is also allowed.
preferred_charset=

# preferred_language specifies the language in MIME notation (e.g., en,
# fr, may be a comma-separated list in decreasing preference)
# which Lynx will indicate you prefer in requests to http servers.
# If a file in that language is available, the server will send it.
# Otherwise, the server will send the file in its default language.
preferred_language=en

# select_popups specifies whether the OPTIONs in a SELECT block which
# lacks a MULTIPLE attribute are presented as a vertical list of radio
# buttons or via a popup menu.  Note that if the MULTIPLE attribute is
# present in the SELECT start tag, Lynx always will create a vertical list
# of checkboxes for the OPTIONs.  A value of "on" will set popup menus
# as the default while a value of "off" will set use of radio boxes.
# The default can be overridden via the -popup command line toggle.
select_popups=on

# show_color specifies how to set the color mode at startup.  A value of
# "never" will force color mode off (treat the terminal as monochrome)
# at startup even if the terminal appears to be color capable.  A value of
# "always" will force color mode on even if the terminal appears to be
# monochrome, if this is supported by the library used to build lynx.
# A value of "default" will yield the behavior of assuming
# a monochrome terminal unless color capability is inferred at startup
# based on the terminal type, or the -color command line switch is used, or
# the COLORTERM environment variable is set.  The default behavior always is
# used in anonymous accounts or if the "option_save" restriction is set.
# The effect of the saved value can be overridden via
# the -color and -nocolor command line switches.
# The mode set at startup can be changed via the "show color" option in
# the 'o'ptions menu.  If the option settings are saved, the "on" and
# "off" "show color" settings will be treated as "default".
show_color=default

# show_cursor specifies whether to 'hide' the cursor to the right (and
# bottom, if possible) of the screen, or to place it to the left of the
# current link in documents, or current option in select popup windows.
# Positioning the cursor to the left of the current link or option is
# helpful for speech or braille interfaces, and when the terminal is
# one which does not distinguish the current link based on highlighting
# or color.  A value of "on" will set positioning to the left as the
# default while a value of "off" will set 'hiding' of the cursor.
# The default can be overridden via the -show_cursor command line toggle.
show_cursor=on

# show_dotfiles specifies that the directory listing should include
# "hidden" (dot) files/directories.  If set "on", this will be
# honored only if enabled via userdefs.h and/or lynx.cfg, and not
# restricted via a command line switch.  If display of hidden files
# is disabled, creation of such files via Lynx also is disabled.
show_dotfiles=off

# If sub_bookmarks is not turned "off", and multiple bookmarks have
# been defined (see below), then all bookmark operations will first
# prompt the user to select an active sub-bookmark file.  If the default
# Lynx bookmark_file is defined (see above), it will be used as the
# default selection.  When this option is set to "advanced", and the
# user mode is advanced, the 'v'iew bookmark command will invoke a
# statusline prompt instead of the menu seen in novice and intermediate
# user modes.  When this option is set to "standard", the menu will be
# presented regardless of user mode.
sub_bookmarks=ADVANCED

# user_mode specifies the users level of knowledge with Lynx.  The
# default is "NOVICE" which displays two extra lines of help at the
# bottom of the screen to aid the user in learning the basic Lynx
# commands.  Set user_mode to "INTERMEDIATE" to turn off the extra info.
# Use "ADVANCED" to see the URL of the currently selected link at the
# bottom of the screen.
user_mode=ADVANCED

# If verbose_images is "on", lynx will print the name of the image
# source file in place of [INLINE], [LINK] or [IMAGE]
# See also VERBOSE_IMAGES in lynx.cfg

# If vi_keys is set to "on", then the normal VI movement keys:
#   j = down    k = up
#   h = left    l = right
# will be enabled.  These keys are only lower case.
# Capital 'H', 'J' and 'K will still activate help, jump shortcuts,
