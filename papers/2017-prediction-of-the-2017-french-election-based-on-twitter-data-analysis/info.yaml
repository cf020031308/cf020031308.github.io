title: Prediction of the 2017 French election based on Twitter data analysis
type: inproceedings
year: '2017'
abstract: "Twitter is a social network that lets users post their
opinions about current affairs, share their social events, and
interact with others. Twitter has now become one of the largest
sources of news, with over 200 million active users monthly. This
paper proposes a method to predict election results based on
Twitter data analysis. The method extracts and analyses
sentimental information from microblogs to predict the popularity
of candidates. The proposed method was used for predicting the
result of the 2017 French presidential election. It has been shown
that the proposed method significantly outperformed the
Tumasjan's method, a well-recognized method for election
prediction based on Twitter data. "
