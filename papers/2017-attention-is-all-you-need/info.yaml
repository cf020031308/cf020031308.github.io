abstract: 'The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent
  or

  convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best

  performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention

  mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based

  solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions

  entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be

  superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly

  less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014

  English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results,

  including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French

  translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art

  BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction

  of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the

  Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to

  English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.'
