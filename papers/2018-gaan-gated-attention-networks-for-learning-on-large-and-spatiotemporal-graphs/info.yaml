abstract: 'We propose a new network architecture, Gated Attention Networks (GaAN),
  for

  learning on graphs. Unlike the traditional multi-head attention mechanism,

  which equally consumes all attention heads, GaAN uses a convolutional

  sub-network to control each attention head''s importance. We demonstrate the

  effectiveness of GaAN on the inductive node classification problem. Moreover,

  with GaAN as a building block, we construct the Graph Gated Recurrent Unit

  (GGRU) to address the traffic speed forecasting problem. Extensive experiments

  on three real-world datasets show that our GaAN framework achieves

  state-of-the-art results on both tasks.'
