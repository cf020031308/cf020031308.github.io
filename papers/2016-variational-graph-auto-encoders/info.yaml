abstract: 'We introduce the variational graph auto-encoder (VGAE), a framework for

  unsupervised learning on graph-structured data based on the variational

  auto-encoder (VAE). This model makes use of latent variables and is capable of

  learning interpretable latent representations for undirected graphs. We

  demonstrate this model using a graph convolutional network (GCN) encoder and a

  simple inner product decoder. Our model achieves competitive results on a link

  prediction task in citation networks. In contrast to most existing models for

  unsupervised learning on graph-structured data and link prediction, our model

  can naturally incorporate node features, which significantly improves

  predictive performance on a number of benchmark datasets.'
