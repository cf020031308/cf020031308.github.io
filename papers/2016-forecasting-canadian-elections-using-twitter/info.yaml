abstract: 'Experiments forecasting Canadian elections with Twitter are presented. A methodology for creating a representative Twitter sample is described and validated against census data. This sample and election polls are input into a VARX forecast model. The model covariance error monitors the forecast accuracy, measuring forecast confidence before the election occurs. The model is tested on several Canadian elections.'
