abstract: 'We present a new approach for the approximate K-nearest neighbor search
  based

  on navigable small world graphs with controllable hierarchy (Hierarchical NSW,

  HNSW). The proposed solution is fully graph-based, without any need for

  additional search structures, which are typically used at the coarse search

  stage of the most proximity graph techniques. Hierarchical NSW incrementally

  builds a multi-layer structure consisting from hierarchical set of proximity

  graphs (layers) for nested subsets of the stored elements. The maximum layer in

  which an element is present is selected randomly with an exponentially decaying

  probability distribution. This allows producing graphs similar to the

  previously studied Navigable Small World (NSW) structures while additionally

  having the links separated by their characteristic distance scales. Starting

  search from the upper layer together with utilizing the scale separation boosts

  the performance compared to NSW and allows a logarithmic complexity scaling.

  Additional employment of a heuristic for selecting proximity graph neighbors

  significantly increases performance at high recall and in case of highly

  clustered data. Performance evaluation has demonstrated that the proposed

  general metric space search index is able to strongly outperform previous

  opensource state-of-the-art vector-only approaches. Similarity of the algorithm

  to the skip list structure allows straightforward balanced distributed

  implementation.'
