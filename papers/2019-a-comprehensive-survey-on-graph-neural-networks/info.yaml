abstract: 'Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent
  years,

  ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition

  and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically

  represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of

  applications where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are

  represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between

  objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on

  existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep

  learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this survey, we provide a

  comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and

  machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the

  state-of-the-art graph neural networks into four categories, namely recurrent

  graph neural networks, convolutional graph neural networks, graph autoencoders,

  and spatial-temporal graph neural networks. We further discuss the applications

  of graph neural networks across various domains and summarize the open source

  codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of graph neural networks.

  Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing

  field.'
