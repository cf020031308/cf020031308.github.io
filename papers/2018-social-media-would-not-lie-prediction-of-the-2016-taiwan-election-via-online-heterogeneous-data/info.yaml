abstract: 'The prevalence of online media has attracted researchers from various domains

  to explore human behavior and make interesting predictions. In this research,

  we leverage heterogeneous social media data collected from various online

  platforms to predict Taiwan''s 2016 presidential election. In contrast to most

  existing research, we take a "signal" view of heterogeneous information and

  adopt the Kalman filter to fuse multiple signals into daily vote predictions

  for the candidates. We also consider events that influenced the election in a

  quantitative manner based on the so-called event study model that originated in

  the field of financial research. We obtained the following interesting

  findings. First, public opinions in online media dominate traditional polls in

  Taiwan election prediction in terms of both predictive power and timeliness.

  But offline polls can still function on alleviating the sample bias of online

  opinions. Second, although online signals converge as election day approaches,

  the simple Facebook "Like" is consistently the strongest indicator of the

  election result. Third, most influential events have a strong connection to

  cross-strait relations, and the Chou Tzu-yu flag incident followed by the

  apology video one day before the election increased the vote share of Tsai

  Ing-Wen by 3.66%. This research justifies the predictive power of online media

  in politics and the advantages of information fusion. The combined use of the

  Kalman filter and the event study method contributes to the data-driven

  political analytics paradigm for both prediction and attribution purposes.'
