abstract: 'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the predominant technique for learning
  over

  graphs. However, there is relatively little understanding of why GNNs are

  successful in practice and whether they are necessary for good performance.

  Here, we show that for many standard transductive node classification

  benchmarks, we can exceed or match the performance of state-of-the-art GNNs by

  combining shallow models that ignore the graph structure with two simple

  post-processing steps that exploit correlation in the label structure: (i) an

  "error correlation" that spreads residual errors in training data to correct

  errors in test data and (ii) a "prediction correlation" that smooths the

  predictions on the test data. We call this overall procedure Correct and Smooth

  (C&S), and the post-processing steps are implemented via simple modifications

  to standard label propagation techniques from early graph-based semi-supervised

  learning methods. Our approach exceeds or nearly matches the performance of

  state-of-the-art GNNs on a wide variety of benchmarks, with just a small

  fraction of the parameters and orders of magnitude faster runtime. For

  instance, we exceed the best known GNN performance on the OGB-Products dataset

  with 137 times fewer parameters and greater than 100 times less training time.

  The performance of our methods highlights how directly incorporating label

  information into the learning algorithm (as was done in traditional techniques)

  yields easy and substantial performance gains. We can also incorporate our

  techniques into big GNN models, providing modest gains. Our code for the OGB
