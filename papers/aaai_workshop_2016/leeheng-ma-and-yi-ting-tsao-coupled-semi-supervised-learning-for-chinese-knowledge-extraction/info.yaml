abstract: 'Robust intelligent systems may leverage knowledge about the world to cope with a variety of contexts. While automatic knowledge extraction algorithms have been successfully used to build knowledge bases in English, little progress has been made in extracting non-alphabetic languages, e.g. Chinese. This paper identifies the key challenge in instance and pattern extraction for Chinese and presents the Coupled Chinese Pattern Learner that utilizes part-of-speech tagging and language-dependent grammar rules for generalized matching in the Chinese never-ending language learner framework for large-scale knowledge extraction from online documents. Experiments showed that the proposed system is scalable and achieves a precision of 79.9% in learning categories after a small number of iterations.'
