abstract: 'Staying up to date with the latest discoveries is a challenge in any scientific field. In planetary science, new observation targets on the surface of Mars are identified and named every day, and new publications announcing new discoveries and conclusions provide frequent updates about these targets. We are constructing a system that uses information extraction and retrieval methods to mine the steadily growing body of planetary science publications about Mars surface targets and automatically construct a concise summary of what is known about each target. The Mars Target Encyclopedia will provide a central, continually updated resource for use by planetary scientists and the interested public. We describe our use of Tika, Sundance, and AutoSlog to extract and summarize information, some of the challenges associated with this domain, and our plans for maturing the system.'
