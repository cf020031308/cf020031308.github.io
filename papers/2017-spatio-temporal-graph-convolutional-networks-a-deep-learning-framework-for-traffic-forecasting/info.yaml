abstract: 'Timely accurate traffic forecast is crucial for urban traffic control and

  guidance. Due to the high nonlinearity and complexity of traffic flow,

  traditional methods cannot satisfy the requirements of mid-and-long term

  prediction tasks and often neglect spatial and temporal dependencies. In this

  paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework, Spatio-Temporal Graph

  Convolutional Networks (STGCN), to tackle the time series prediction problem in

  traffic domain. Instead of applying regular convolutional and recurrent units,

  we formulate the problem on graphs and build the model with complete

  convolutional structures, which enable much faster training speed with fewer

  parameters. Experiments show that our model STGCN effectively captures

  comprehensive spatio-temporal correlations through modeling multi-scale traffic

  networks and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various

  real-world traffic datasets.'
