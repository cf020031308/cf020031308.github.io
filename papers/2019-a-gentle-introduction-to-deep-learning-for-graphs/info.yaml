abstract: 'The adaptive processing of graph data is a long-standing research topic
  which

  has been lately consolidated as a theme of major interest in the deep learning

  community. The snap increase in the amount and breadth of related research has

  come at the price of little systematization of knowledge and attention to

  earlier literature. This work is designed as a tutorial introduction to the

  field of deep learning for graphs. It favours a consistent and progressive

  introduction of the main concepts and architectural aspects over an exposition

  of the most recent literature, for which the reader is referred to available

  surveys. The paper takes a top-down view to the problem, introducing a

  generalized formulation of graph representation learning based on a local and

  iterative approach to structured information processing. It introduces the

  basic building blocks that can be combined to design novel and effective neural

  models for graphs. The methodological exposition is complemented by a

  discussion of interesting research challenges and applications in the field.'
