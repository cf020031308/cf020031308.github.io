abstract: 'Graphs, such as social networks, word co-occurrence networks, and

  communication networks, occur naturally in various real-world applications.

  Analyzing them yields insight into the structure of society, language, and

  different patterns of communication. Many approaches have been proposed to

  perform the analysis. Recently, methods which use the representation of graph

  nodes in vector space have gained traction from the research community. In this

  survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured analysis of various graph

  embedding techniques proposed in the literature. We first introduce the

  embedding task and its challenges such as scalability, choice of

  dimensionality, and features to be preserved, and their possible solutions. We

  then present three categories of approaches based on factorization methods,

  random walks, and deep learning, with examples of representative algorithms in

  each category and analysis of their performance on various tasks. We evaluate

  these state-of-the-art methods on a few common datasets and compare their

  performance against one another. Our analysis concludes by suggesting some

  potential applications and future directions. We finally present the

  open-source Python library we developed, named GEM (Graph Embedding Methods,

  available at https://github.com/palash1992/GEM), which provides all presented

  algorithms within a unified interface to foster and facilitate research on the

  topic.'
