abstract: 'Label Propagation (LPA) and Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCN) are

  both message passing algorithms on graphs. Both solve the task of node

  classification but LPA propagates node label information across the edges of

  the graph, while GCN propagates and transforms node feature information.

  However, while conceptually similar, theoretical relation between LPA and GCN

  has not yet been investigated. Here we study the relationship between LPA and

  GCN in terms of two aspects: (1) feature/label smoothing where we analyze how

  the feature/label of one node is spread over its neighbors; And, (2)

  feature/label influence of how much the initial feature/label of one node

  influences the final feature/label of another node. Based on our theoretical

  analysis, we propose an end-to-end model that unifies GCN and LPA for node

  classification. In our unified model, edge weights are learnable, and the LPA

  serves as regularization to assist the GCN in learning proper edge weights that

  lead to improved classification performance. Our model can also be seen as

  learning attention weights based on node labels, which is more task-oriented

  than existing feature-based attention models. In a number of experiments on

  real-world graphs, our model shows superiority over state-of-the-art GCN-based

  methods in terms of node classification accuracy.'
