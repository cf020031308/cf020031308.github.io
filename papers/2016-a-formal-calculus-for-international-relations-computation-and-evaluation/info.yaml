abstract: 'This publication presents a relation computation or calculus for

  international relations using a mathematical modeling. It examined trust for

  international relations and its calculus, which related to Bayesian inference,

  Dempster-Shafer theory and subjective logic. Based on an observation in the

  literature, we found no literature discussing the calculus method for the

  international relations. To bridge this research gap, we propose a relation

  algebra method for international relations computation. The proposed method

  will allow a relation computation which is previously subjective and

  incomputable. We also present three international relations as case studies to

  demonstrate the proposed method is a real-world scenario. The method will

  deliver the relation computation for the international relations that to

  support decision makers in a government such as foreign ministry, defense

  ministry, presidential or prime minister office. The Department of Defense

  (DoD) may use our method to determine a nation that can be identified as a

  friendly, neutral or hostile nation.'
