abstract: 'Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI) has renewed interest in

  building systems that learn and think like people. Many advances have come from

  using deep neural networks trained end-to-end in tasks such as object

  recognition, video games, and board games, achieving performance that equals or

  even beats humans in some respects. Despite their biological inspiration and

  performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in

  crucial ways. We review progress in cognitive science suggesting that truly

  human-like learning and thinking machines will have to reach beyond current

  engineering trends in both what they learn, and how they learn it.

  Specifically, we argue that these machines should (a) build causal models of

  the world that support explanation and understanding, rather than merely

  solving pattern recognition problems; (b) ground learning in intuitive theories

  of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned;

  and (c) harness compositionality and learning-to-learn to rapidly acquire and

  generalize knowledge to new tasks and situations. We suggest concrete

  challenges and promising routes towards these goals that can combine the

  strengths of recent neural network advances with more structured cognitive

  models.'
