abstract: 'How can we perform efficient inference and learning in directed probabilistic

  models, in the presence of continuous latent variables with intractable

  posterior distributions, and large datasets? We introduce a stochastic

  variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and,

  under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable

  case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization

  of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be

  straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second,

  we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per

  datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an

  approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the

  intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical

  advantages are reflected in experimental results.'
