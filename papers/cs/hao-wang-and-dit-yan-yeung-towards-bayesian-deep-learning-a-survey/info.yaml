abstract: 'While perception tasks such as visual object recognition and text

  understanding play an important role in human intelligence, the subsequent

  tasks that involve inference, reasoning and planning require an even higher

  level of intelligence. The past few years have seen major advances in many

  perception tasks using deep learning models. For higher-level inference,

  however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still

  more powerful and flexible. To achieve integrated intelligence that involves

  both perception and inference, it is naturally desirable to tightly integrate

  deep learning and Bayesian models within a principled probabilistic framework,

  which we call Bayesian deep learning. In this unified framework, the perception

  of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level

  inference and in return, the feedback from the inference process is able to

  enhance the perception of text or images. This survey provides a general

  introduction to Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on

  recommender systems, topic models, and control. In this survey, we also discuss

  the relationship and differences between Bayesian deep learning and other

  related topics like Bayesian treatment of neural networks.'
