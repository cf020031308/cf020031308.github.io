abstract: 'Deep learning has achieved a remarkable performance breakthrough in several

  fields, most notably in speech recognition, natural language processing, and

  computer vision. In particular, convolutional neural network (CNN)

  architectures currently produce state-of-the-art performance on a variety of

  image analysis tasks such as object detection and recognition. Most of deep

  learning research has so far focused on dealing with 1D, 2D, or 3D

  Euclidean-structured data such as acoustic signals, images, or videos.

  Recently, there has been an increasing interest in geometric deep learning,

  attempting to generalize deep learning methods to non-Euclidean structured data

  such as graphs and manifolds, with a variety of applications from the domains

  of network analysis, computational social science, or computer graphics. In

  this paper, we propose a unified framework allowing to generalize CNN

  architectures to non-Euclidean domains (graphs and manifolds) and learn local,

  stationary, and compositional task-specific features. We show that various

  non-Euclidean CNN methods previously proposed in the literature can be

  considered as particular instances of our framework. We test the proposed

  method on standard tasks from the realms of image-, graph- and 3D shape

  analysis and show that it consistently outperforms previous approaches.'
