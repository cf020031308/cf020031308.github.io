abstract: 'PyHoshen is a framework for Bayesian MCMC election-polling written in pymc3. pymc3 is designed as an “Inference button” - just write the statistical model in high-level python and push the “Inference buttom” and it translates the code into a Bayesian MCMC model. Computing the model might take some time, but pymc3 uses C++ and the GPU to provide extra computational speed. Similarly, pyHoshen attempts to be the “Inference button” for election-polling - just feed in the polls and set up the election parameters, and it translates the polls into the statistical model for pymc3.'
