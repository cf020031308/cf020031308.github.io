abstract: '{Protein secondary structure prediction is a fundamental precursor to many
  bioinformatics tasks. Nearly all state-of-the-art tools when computing their secondary
  structure prediction do not explicitly leverage the vast number of proteins whose
  structure is known. Leveraging this additional information in a so-called template-based
  method has the potential to significantly boost prediction accuracy.We present a
  new hybrid approach to secondary structure prediction that gains the advantages
  of both template- and non-template-based methods. Our core template-based method
  is an algorithmic approach that uses metric-space nearest neighbor search over a
  template database of fixed-length amino acid words to determine estimated class-membership
  probabilities for each residue in the protein. These probabilities are then input
  to a dynamic programming algorithm that finds a physically valid maximum-likelihood
  prediction for the entire protein. Our hybrid approach exploits a novel accuracy
  estimator for our core method, which estimates the unknown true accuracy of its
  prediction, to discern when to switch between template- and non-template-based methods.On
  challenging CASP benchmarks, the resulting hybrid approach boosts the state-of-the-art
  Q8 accuracy by more than 2–10\\%, and Q3 accuracy by more than 1–3\\%, yielding
  the most accurate method currently available for both 3- and 8-state secondary structure
  prediction.A preliminary implementation in a new tool we call Nnessy is available
  free for non-commercial use at http://nnessy.cs.arizona.edu.}'
