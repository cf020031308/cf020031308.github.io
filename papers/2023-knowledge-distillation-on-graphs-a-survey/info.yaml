abstract: 'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted tremendous attention by

  demonstrating their capability to handle graph data. However, they are

  difficult to be deployed in resource-limited devices due to model sizes and

  scalability constraints imposed by the multi-hop data dependency. In addition,

  real-world graphs usually possess complex structural information and features.

  Therefore, to improve the applicability of GNNs and fully encode the

  complicated topological information, knowledge distillation on graphs (KDG) has

  been introduced to build a smaller yet effective model and exploit more

  knowledge from data, leading to model compression and performance improvement.

  Recently, KDG has achieved considerable progress with many studies proposed. In

  this survey, we systematically review these works. Specifically, we first

  introduce KDG challenges and bases, then categorize and summarize existing

  works of KDG by answering the following three questions: 1) what to distillate,

  2) who to whom, and 3) how to distillate. Finally, we share our thoughts on

  future research directions.'
