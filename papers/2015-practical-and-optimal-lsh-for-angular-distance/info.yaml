abstract: 'We show the existence of a Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) family for
  the

  angular distance that yields an approximate Near Neighbor Search algorithm with

  the asymptotically optimal running time exponent. Unlike earlier algorithms

  with this property (e.g., Spherical LSH [Andoni, Indyk, Nguyen, Razenshteyn

  2014], [Andoni, Razenshteyn 2015]), our algorithm is also practical, improving

  upon the well-studied hyperplane LSH [Charikar, 2002] in practice. We also

  introduce a multiprobe version of this algorithm, and conduct experimental

  evaluation on real and synthetic data sets.

  We complement the above positive results with a fine-grained lower bound for

  the quality of any LSH family for angular distance. Our lower bound implies

  that the above LSH family exhibits a trade-off between evaluation time and

  quality that is close to optimal for a natural class of LSH functions.'
