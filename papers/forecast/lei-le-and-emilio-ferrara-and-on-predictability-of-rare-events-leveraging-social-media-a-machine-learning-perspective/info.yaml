abstract: 'Information extracted from social media streams has been leveraged to

  forecast the outcome of a large number of real-world events, from political

  elections to stock market fluctuations. An increasing amount of studies

  demonstrates how the analysis of social media conversations provides cheap

  access to the wisdom of the crowd. However, extents and contexts in which such

  forecasting power can be effectively leveraged are still unverified at least in

  a systematic way. It is also unclear how social-media-based predictions compare

  to those based on alternative information sources. To address these issues,

  here we develop a machine learning framework that leverages social media

  streams to automatically identify and predict the outcomes of soccer matches.

  We focus in particular on matches in which at least one of the possible

  outcomes is deemed as highly unlikely by professional bookmakers. We argue that

  sport events offer a systematic approach for testing the predictive power of

  social media, and allow to compare such power against the rigorous baselines

  set by external sources. Despite such strict baselines, our framework yields

  above 8% marginal profit when used to inform simple betting strategies. The

  system is based on real-time sentiment analysis and exploits data collected

  immediately before the games, allowing for informed bets. We discuss the

  rationale behind our approach, describe the learning framework, its prediction

  performance and the return it provides as compared to a set of betting

  strategies. To test our framework we use both historical Twitter data from the

  2014 FIFA World Cup games, and real-time Twitter data collected by monitoring

  the conversations about all soccer matches of four major European tournaments

  (FA Premier League, Serie A, La Liga, and Bundesliga), and the 2014 UEFA

  Champions League, during the period between Oct. 25th 2014 and Nov. 26th 2014.'
