abstract: 'Graph convolutional network (GCN) has been successfully applied to many

  graph-based applications; however, training a large-scale GCN remains

  challenging. Current SGD-based algorithms suffer from either a high

  computational cost that exponentially grows with number of GCN layers, or a

  large space requirement for keeping the entire graph and the embedding of each

  node in memory. In this paper, we propose Cluster-GCN, a novel GCN algorithm

  that is suitable for SGD-based training by exploiting the graph clustering

  structure. Cluster-GCN works as the following: at each step, it samples a block

  of nodes that associate with a dense subgraph identified by a graph clustering

  algorithm, and restricts the neighborhood search within this subgraph. This

  simple but effective strategy leads to significantly improved memory and

  computational efficiency while being able to achieve comparable test accuracy

  with previous algorithms. To test the scalability of our algorithm, we create a

  new Amazon2M data with 2 million nodes and 61 million edges which is more than

  5 times larger than the previous largest publicly available dataset (Reddit).

  For training a 3-layer GCN on this data, Cluster-GCN is faster than the

  previous state-of-the-art VR-GCN (1523 seconds vs 1961 seconds) and using much

  less memory (2.2GB vs 11.2GB). Furthermore, for training 4 layer GCN on this

  data, our algorithm can finish in around 36 minutes while all the existing GCN

  training algorithms fail to train due to the out-of-memory issue. Furthermore,

  Cluster-GCN allows us to train much deeper GCN without much time and memory

  overhead, which leads to improved prediction accuracy---using a 5-layer

  Cluster-GCN, we achieve state-of-the-art test F1 score 99.36 on the PPI

  dataset, while the previous best result was 98.71 by [16]. Our codes are
