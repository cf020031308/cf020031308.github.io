abstract: 'This paper studies semi-supervised object classification in relational
  data,

  which is a fundamental problem in relational data modeling. The problem has

  been extensively studied in the literature of both statistical relational

  learning (e.g. relational Markov networks) and graph neural networks (e.g.

  graph convolutional networks). Statistical relational learning methods can

  effectively model the dependency of object labels through conditional random

  fields for collective classification, whereas graph neural networks learn

  effective object representations for classification through end-to-end

  training. In this paper, we propose the Graph Markov Neural Network (GMNN) that

  combines the advantages of both worlds. A GMNN models the joint distribution of

  object labels with a conditional random field, which can be effectively trained

  with the variational EM algorithm. In the E-step, one graph neural network

  learns effective object representations for approximating the posterior

  distributions of object labels. In the M-step, another graph neural network is

  used to model the local label dependency. Experiments on object classification,

  link classification, and unsupervised node representation learning show that

  GMNN achieves state-of-the-art results.'
