abstract: 'We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands

  for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent

  language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep

  bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on

  both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT

  model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create

  state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering

  and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture

  modifications.

  BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new

  state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including

  pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI

  accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering

  Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1

  (5.1 point absolute improvement).'
