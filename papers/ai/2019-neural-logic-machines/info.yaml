abstract: 'We propose the Neural Logic Machine (NLM), a neural-symbolic architecture
  for

  both inductive learning and logic reasoning. NLMs exploit the power of both

  neural networks---as function approximators, and logic programming---as a

  symbolic processor for objects with properties, relations, logic connectives,

  and quantifiers. After being trained on small-scale tasks (such as sorting

  short arrays), NLMs can recover lifted rules, and generalize to large-scale

  tasks (such as sorting longer arrays). In our experiments, NLMs achieve perfect

  generalization in a number of tasks, from relational reasoning tasks on the

  family tree and general graphs, to decision making tasks including sorting

  arrays, finding shortest paths, and playing the blocks world. Most of these

  tasks are hard to accomplish for neural networks or inductive logic programming

  alone.'
