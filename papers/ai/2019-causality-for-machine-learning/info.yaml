abstract: 'Graphical causal inference as pioneered by Judea Pearl arose from research
  on

  artificial intelligence (AI), and for a long time had little connection to the

  field of machine learning.

  This article discusses where links have been and should be established,

  introducing key concepts along the way. It argues that the hard open problems

  of machine learning and AI are intrinsically related to causality, and explains

  how the field is beginning to understand them.'
