abstract: 'Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making

  major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and

  decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute

  resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many

  defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much

  different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular,

  generalizing beyond one''s experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from

  infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI.

  The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We

  argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to

  achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and

  computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature

  and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between

  "hand-engineering" and "end-to-end" learning, and instead advocate for an

  approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how

  using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can

  facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We

  present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational

  inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various

  approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a

  straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing

  structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational

  reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more

  sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a

  companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for

  building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.'
