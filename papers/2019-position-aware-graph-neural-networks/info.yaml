abstract: 'Learning node embeddings that capture a node''s position within the broader

  graph structure is crucial for many prediction tasks on graphs. However,

  existing Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures have limited power in

  capturing the position/location of a given node with respect to all other nodes

  of the graph. Here we propose Position-aware Graph Neural Networks (P-GNNs), a

  new class of GNNs for computing position-aware node embeddings. P-GNN first

  samples sets of anchor nodes, computes the distance of a given target node to

  each anchor-set,and then learns a non-linear distance-weighted aggregation

  scheme over the anchor-sets. This way P-GNNs can capture positions/locations of

  nodes with respect to the anchor nodes. P-GNNs have several advantages: they

  are inductive, scalable,and can incorporate node feature information. We apply

  P-GNNs to multiple prediction tasks including link prediction and community

  detection. We show that P-GNNs consistently outperform state of the art GNNs,

  with up to 66% improvement in terms of the ROC AUC score.'
