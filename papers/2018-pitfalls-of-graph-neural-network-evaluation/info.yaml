abstract: 'Semi-supervised node classification in graphs is a fundamental problem
  in

  graph mining, and the recently proposed graph neural networks (GNNs) have

  achieved unparalleled results on this task. Due to their massive success, GNNs

  have attracted a lot of attention, and many novel architectures have been put

  forward. In this paper we show that existing evaluation strategies for GNN

  models have serious shortcomings. We show that using the same

  train/validation/test splits of the same datasets, as well as making

  significant changes to the training procedure (e.g. early stopping criteria)

  precludes a fair comparison of different architectures. We perform a thorough

  empirical evaluation of four prominent GNN models and show that considering

  different splits of the data leads to dramatically different rankings of

  models. Even more importantly, our findings suggest that simpler GNN

  architectures are able to outperform the more sophisticated ones if the

  hyperparameters and the training procedure are tuned fairly for all models.'
