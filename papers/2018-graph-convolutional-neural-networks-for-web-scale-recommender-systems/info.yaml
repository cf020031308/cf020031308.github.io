abstract: 'Recent advancements in deep neural networks for graph-structured data have

  led to state-of-the-art performance on recommender system benchmarks. However,

  making these methods practical and scalable to web-scale recommendation tasks

  with billions of items and hundreds of millions of users remains a challenge.

  Here we describe a large-scale deep recommendation engine that we developed and

  deployed at Pinterest. We develop a data-efficient Graph Convolutional Network

  (GCN) algorithm PinSage, which combines efficient random walks and graph

  convolutions to generate embeddings of nodes (i.e., items) that incorporate

  both graph structure as well as node feature information. Compared to prior GCN

  approaches, we develop a novel method based on highly efficient random walks to

  structure the convolutions and design a novel training strategy that relies on

  harder-and-harder training examples to improve robustness and convergence of

  the model. We also develop an efficient MapReduce model inference algorithm to

  generate embeddings using a trained model. We deploy PinSage at Pinterest and

  train it on 7.5 billion examples on a graph with 3 billion nodes representing

  pins and boards, and 18 billion edges. According to offline metrics, user

  studies and A/B tests, PinSage generates higher-quality recommendations than

  comparable deep learning and graph-based alternatives. To our knowledge, this

  is the largest application of deep graph embeddings to date and paves the way

  for a new generation of web-scale recommender systems based on graph

  convolutional architectures.'
