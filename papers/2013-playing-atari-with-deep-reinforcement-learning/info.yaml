abstract: 'We present the first deep learning model to successfully learn control

  policies directly from high-dimensional sensory input using reinforcement

  learning. The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant

  of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function

  estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from

  the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or

  learning algorithm. We find that it outperforms all previous approaches on six

  of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them.'
