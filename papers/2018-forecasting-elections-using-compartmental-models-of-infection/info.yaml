abstract: 'To forecast political elections, popular pollsters and forecasters gather

  polls and combine information from them with fundamental data such as

  historical trends, the national economy, and incumbency. This process is

  complicated, and it includes many subjective choices (e.g., when identifying

  likely voters, estimating turnout, and quantifying other sources of

  uncertainty), leading to forecasts that differ between sources even when they

  use the same underlying polling data. With the goal of shedding light on

  election forecasts (using the United States as an example), we develop a theory

  for forecasting elections from the perspective of dynamical systems. Through a

  simple approach that borrows ideas from epidemiology, we show how to combine a

  compartmental model of disease spreading with public polling data to forecast

  gubernatorial, senatorial, and presidential elections at the state level. Our

  results for the 2012 and 2016 U.S. races are largely in agreement with those of

  popular forecasters, and we use our new model to explore how subjective choices

  about uncertainty impact results. Our goals are to open new avenues for

  improving how elections are forecast, to increase understanding of the results

  that are reported by popular news sources, and to illustrate the value of

  data-driven forecasting using dynamical systems. We conclude with our forecast

  of the senatorial and gubernatorial races in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections of

  6 November, which we posted online as a preprint on 5 November.'
