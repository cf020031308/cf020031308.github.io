abstract: 'Graph neural network (GNN) and label propagation algorithm (LPA) are both

  message passing algorithms, which have achieved superior performance in

  semi-supervised classification. GNN performs feature propagation by a neural

  network to make predictions, while LPA uses label propagation across graph

  adjacency matrix to get results. However, there is still no effective way to

  directly combine these two kinds of algorithms. To address this issue, we

  propose a novel Unified Message Passaging Model (UniMP) that can incorporate

  feature and label propagation at both training and inference time. First, UniMP

  adopts a Graph Transformer network, taking feature embedding and label

  embedding as input information for propagation. Second, to train the network

  without overfitting in self-loop input label information, UniMP introduces a

  masked label prediction strategy, in which some percentage of input label

  information are masked at random, and then predicted. UniMP conceptually

  unifies feature propagation and label propagation and is empirically powerful.

  It obtains new state-of-the-art semi-supervised classification results in Open

  Graph Benchmark (OGB).'
